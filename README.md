## 1. AUROC vs AUPRC: The Problem with Class Imbalance

In medicine and many real-world datasets, we often encounter **class imbalance** — where the majority of patients are healthy (the "negative" class), and only a few have the specific disease (the "positive" class).

This interactive demo illustrates how class imbalance affects common evaluation metrics:

- **AU-ROC** (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve): Measures how well the model separates positive and negative classes. It is **robust** but may appear **overly optimistic** in imbalanced datasets.
  
- **AU-PRC** (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve): Highlights the **trade-off between precision and recall**. It is **more sensitive to class imbalance**, making it particularly useful in fields like **clinical screening**.

➡️ Try the demo to see how your model's performance looks under different levels of imbalance.

## 2. QR Code Generator

A fast, privacy-preserving QR code generator. This app allows you to:

- Generate QR codes offline (no server required)
- Encode text, URLs, or any string data
- Use it freely for personal or professional projects

➡️ Try it out to generate QR codes on the fly without worrying about data leakage.
